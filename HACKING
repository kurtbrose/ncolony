NColony is developed in a double-test-driven methodoloy.
This means:
* Do not write code if there are no failing unit tests
* Do not write unit tests if there are no failing integration tests

The proper way to implement a feature if to first write an integration
test that exercises that feature "from the outside". This will fail.
Then write unit tests that "fail in the same way", but with every unit
tests using mocking to isolate it. Then fix those unit tests, and
see if this fixed the integration test. If not, add/change the unit tests.
